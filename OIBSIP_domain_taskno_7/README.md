# Nikto Vulnerability Scan Report

## Overview

This repository contains the results of a vulnerability assessment performed using Nikto web vulnerability scanner on a target web server (192.168.29.214). Nikto is an open-source web vulnerability scanner that performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs.

## Scan Details

- **Target**: 192.168.29.214:80
- **Scanner**: Nikto v2.1.6
- **Date**: August 8, 2025
- **Scan Type**: Comprehensive web vulnerability scan

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Action Required)

1. **phpinfo.php Accessible** ðŸ”´
   - **Impact**: Complete server configuration disclosure
   - **Risk**: Attackers can view sensitive system information including paths, modules, and environment variables
   - **Action**: Remove phpinfo.php file immediately

### High-Risk Vulnerabilities

1. **Outdated Apache Version (2.2.8)** ðŸ”´
   - **Impact**: Known security vulnerabilities present
   - **Risk**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation
   - **Action**: Upgrade to Apache 2.4.56 or later

2. **Outdated PHP Version (5.2.4)** ðŸ”´
   - **Impact**: Multiple known CVEs and security flaws
   - **Risk**: Remote code execution, data breaches
   - **Action**: Upgrade to PHP 8.x immediately

3. **Server Status/Info Pages Exposed** ðŸ”´
   - **Impact**: Detailed system information disclosure
   - **Risk**: Information gathering for further attacks
   - **Action**: Disable mod_status and mod_info modules

### Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities

1. **Missing Security Headers** ðŸŸ¡
   - X-Frame-Options: Missing (clickjacking protection)
   - X-Content-Type-Options: Missing (MIME sniffing protection)
   - **Action**: Implement proper HTTP security headers

2. **phpMyAdmin Accessible** ðŸŸ¡
   - **Impact**: Database administration interface exposed
   - **Risk**: Unauthorized database access
   - **Action**: Secure or remove phpMyAdmin installation

### Low-Risk Issues

1. **Directory Indexing Enabled** ðŸŸ¡
   - **Impact**: Directory contents visible to attackers
   - **Action**: Disable directory browsing

## Technical Analysis

### Server Configuration

- **Web Server**: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) with DAV/2
- **Scripting**: PHP/5.2.4 2ubuntu5.10
- **OS**: Ubuntu (based on package versions)

### Security Posture

The target server exhibits multiple critical security misconfigurations typical of legacy systems:

1. **Outdated Software Stack**: Both Apache and PHP versions are severely outdated (10+ years old)
2. **Information Disclosure**: Multiple sources of sensitive information leakage
3. **Missing Hardening**: Lack of basic security headers and configurations
4. **Default Installations**: Presence of default files and directories

## Risk Assessment

| Category | Count | Risk Level |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Critical | 1 | Immediate Action Required |
| High | 3 | Address Within 24-48 Hours |
| Medium | 6 | Address Within 1-2 Weeks |
| Low | 3+ | Address During Next Maintenance Window |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical Priority)

1. **Remove phpinfo.php** - This file exposes complete server configuration
2. **Update software stack** - Upgrade Apache, PHP, and Ubuntu to supported versions
3. **Disable server status modules** - Remove mod_status and mod_info exposure

### Short-term Actions (1-2 weeks)

1. **Implement security headers**:

   ```apache
   Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
   Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
   Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
   ```

2. **Secure phpMyAdmin** - Implement access controls or remove if not needed
3. **Disable directory indexing**: `Options -Indexes`

### Long-term Security Improvements

1. **Regular security updates** - Implement automated patching
2. **Web Application Firewall** - Deploy ModSecurity or similar
3. **Security monitoring** - Implement logging and monitoring
4. **Regular vulnerability assessments** - Schedule periodic scans

## Compliance Considerations

This server configuration would likely fail compliance requirements for:

- PCI DSS (if processing card data)
- HIPAA (if handling health information)
- SOX (if part of financial systems)
- GDPR (if processing EU personal data)

## Tools Used

- **Nikto v2.1.6**: Primary vulnerability scanner
- **Target Environment**: Ubuntu server with Apache/PHP stack
